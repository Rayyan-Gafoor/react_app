               <h1>The Ever-Growing Divide</h1>
               <p>
                I first heard about this concept of the digital divide in 2020, 
                and only until recently, my idea of this concept was an isolated one.
                For some time now, I have always thought of the ‘Digital Divide’ to 
                only revolve around the internet and its relation to education 
                enhancement. With my recent academic explorations however, within 
                various areas of research, have found that the ‘Digital Divide’ 
                is always lurking in the shadows. The technological shit since the 
                start of the covid-19 pandemic, threatens to increase the growth of 
                this divide exponentially.

               <h2>
               What is the ‘Digital Divide’?
               </h2>
               <p>
               To my understanding ‘Digital Divide’ is the gap that exists between 
               those people who have access to technology and those who have poor 
               to no access to that same technology. It is the very essence of 
               “Digital Inequality”. With the phase of the pandemic this divide
                become more evident as education systems and most of the work sector
                 took an online approach to combat the drastic change of social 
                 distancing. According to an article, “The Digital Divide Widens 
                 (Tataki and Glynos, 2020)”, more than 1.5 billion students have 
                 been affected by this change. However, the change has not affected 
                 everyone the same. While some students can adapt to this change 
                 with ease, others we not able to continue their education, due to 
                 the already existing effects of the divide (Tataki and Glynos, 2020).

               <h5>The following statistics are extracted from the above-mentioned article:</h5>
               <p>
               “According to UNESCO, of all the students currently out of the classroom,
                50% or about 830 million do not have access to a computer. One solution
                has been platforms built for use on basic mobile phones e.g. Funzi and
                Ubongo for African families. But, beside the difficulties of using mobile
                phones for learning, 40% of students do not have any form of access to the
                Internet at home.”

               <p>
                I myself have fallen victim to the effects of this divide. 
                Even though I was provided by the institution the technologies 
                necessary to access the internet, I lacked the resources (data) 
                to use it. This hindered my educational journey and affected my 
                household’s finance greatly. However, plans were made to confront 
                this, by the institution, but to no surprise the system they put in
                place did not work for everyone, including myself. This plan was to
                provide the students with monthly data to use for their educational
                purposes. And after following the instructions to get this data, 
                some of us were left still complaining about not receiving anything, 
                that the data does not allow one to browse the internet and/or the 
                data restricts users to certain sites that serve minimal educational
                 use. 
                Tataki & Glynos confronts these efforts to reduce these disruptions
                 but ultimately refer to them as “short-terms solutions” 
                 (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). What happens after the pandemic crisis 
                 is over? Will the effects it has end with it? The answer is a 
                 simple, ‘No’.

               <h2>Colonialism Gave Birth to the Digital Divide</h2>
               <p>
                This may come off as subjective, but this is the way I see 
                the digital divide now after numerous amounts of research done 
                since the beginning of the year. In a recent essay, I wrote about 
                the “African Cultures in Technology”. Throughout this paper I 
                explore the relation of technology development and the concept of 
                knowledge production (Gafoor, 2022). Colonialism determined the 
                technology and the knowledges Africa was exposed to, and in turn 
                eradicated the already existing knowledge structures that were 
                present in Africa. This all ultimately resulted in Africa’s role 
                in the economy back than as well as today, which is that of a 
                primary resource and raw material supplier. Because of colonialism 
                Africa was forced to stay at this technological and economical state 
                in order to fulfil the needs of the colonizers.
                Due to this, our economy lacks the technologies required for development. As I
                have pointed out:
                “Quijano argues that colonialism continues to survive within the 
                domains of knowledge.” 
                In the end his concept comes down to the “who”, “why” and “how” within the borders 
                of knowledge and its production. Which brings us back to the ‘Digital Divide’. 
                The people who have the capabilities to produce and create the technologies that 
                could enhance our way of life, create these technologies for themselves. 
                They do not consider those who are not like them. Like we have seen in the 
                “Travelling While Trans” (Chock, 2020) and the AI facial recognition system 
                created by the Chinese AI facial recognition system (CNET news, 2020), 
                these systems goes against the “Design Justice Network Principles”.
                 In the end I believe this branches off into a, not new, but a divide in society.

               <h2>Neo-Colonialism and Foundation of the Digital Divide.</h2>
               <p>
                In my paper I also explored the concept of neo-colonialism. 
                I looked at the idea if “Internet Freedom” and the idea of 
                “Internet Sovereignty”. These two concepts in contrast with
                one another. The idea of internet sovereignty is the Chinese
                government policy to control the internet. China aims to 
                spread their influence and invoke this policy globally, 
                and the way they aim to do this is by exploiting the already
                existing effects of colonialism. And when I thought more
                carefully about it, this is ultimately the exploitation 
                of the ‘Digital Divide’. China aims to supply Africa with 
                the technologies that they lack in order to gain economical
                and political control over Africa. If one thinks about it,
                colonialism, gave birth to the ‘Digital Divide’ and that in 
                turn made neo-colonialism possible today. And this is why we
                the Digital Divide affects both the society and the economy.
