                A critical analysis of the interactive, virtual reality artwork, created by Zoe
                Beloff, The Beyond.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why did I choose The Beyond as a Net.Art to analyse… well, I did not, it choose me. Confused about
                the entire topic, I wanted to write on something that I may be somewhat familiar with. Thus,
                resulting in me searching for games in Net.Art. Most of which I found to be removed as a result of
                “The Fall of the Great Dinosaur, Flash”. Nevertheless, I found myself constantly returning to Beloff’s
                project. Which, I must admit scares me, which is why I was so hesitant to use it in the first place.

                Set in a mysterious virtual world, she dives into the concept of technology, mechanical reproduction,
                and time travel as she explores the link between psychoanalysis and the paranormal. As the viewer
                you roam through this world by clicking on various images while also being granted the opportunity
                to read the important notes left behind. The world allows the viewer to explore the interactions
                between the past and the present.

                In her essay The Dream life of Technology, Beloff, reflects on her ideas what led to the creation of
                the Beyond. The location of the virtual world is an abandoned 19th century asylum. This location is
                used to bring life to herideas as she investigates technology of media from the 1850s (the birth of
                media technology) and the 1940s (The Katyn Massacre). It is here where she encourages us to
                engage with the element of death and the idea of artificial resurrection.

                Using “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”by Walter Benjamin, and Net Art,
                Post-internet Art, New Aesthetics: The Fundamentals of Art on the Internet by DANAEwe will look at
                the following:
                • The Idea of Aura within a digital space
                • Film and Photography
                • New aesthetic and Immersion
               </p>
               <h2>
               Aura within the Digital Space.
               </h2>
               <p>
                In his work, Walter Benjamin speaks of the aura an artwork has,referring to its uniqueness and
                authenticity. With the raise of the digital space, we see why Benjamin believed that the aura of art is
                changing and slowly fading away. With more and more art being reproduced digitally and shared
                using the internet as a medium.
                But the idea of an aura within a digital space confused me, specifically when looking at Net.Art. Art
                that exists and cannot exist withoutthe internet. Beloff claims that without the existence of the
                internet, The Beyond project would have not been possible. It is the only medium in which it could
                have been experienced. So how does a digital piece of work, lacking the physical component, carry
                an aura?
                <br></br>
                All of this left me with questions such as:
                • Is internet art born with an aura?
                • If it is born with an aura, how does it lose its aura through a medium in which it cannot exist
                without?

               </p>
               <h2>
               Film And Photography
               </h2>
               <p>
                While Examining the Beyond Project, I came across references used by Beloff.One reference drew
                my attention, simply because Ithought it had a cool name, The Vision Machine by Paul Virilio. In this
                piece there is a particular conversation which he mentions, or rather a discussion, between Auguste
                Rodin and Paul Gsell. This brought about the question which is true and real when perceived.
                “it is art that tells the truth and photography that lies. For in reality time does not stand still” Auguste
                Rodin.
                <br></br>
                Even more concerning is that Beloff, uses photography to create this world, and according to
                Benjamin, photography does not have an aura, due to the simple fact that it is created with the eye
                and not the hands.
                <br></br>
                Although, alongside photography, Beloff uses, poems, diagrams, films and various art forms
                throughoutthis project. She uses these art forms to explore the idea of the paranormal brought
                about the age of mechanical reproduction. The Beyond is a world in which the dead is resurrected as
                Beloff brings them back to life. How does she do this? According to Virilio, although photography
                deceives our perception of reality in that moment, it is the memory behind it that shapes and brings
                meaning to it. Beloff exploits this idea of objects themselves having stories of past lives and uses
                these various forms of art to bring back their memory.
                <br></br>
                “I attempt to […] set them in motion so that they might speak again, but differently. For me, the
                cinematic apparatus is not just machines but more importantly our interaction with them.”
                Allowing the viewer to somewhatrelive those moments in time. Similar to the works of Olia Lialina
                in “My Boyfriend Came Back From War”. Again, I contemplate the question of aura, does this mean
                that the aura of those art works is brought back as well?
                <br></br>
                Beloff stats that the purpose of this project is to illuminate the present through the past. In this we
                see how technology resurrectsthe dead, bringing back old language and arts, through artificial
                resurrection, and how cinema acts as the time machine while her voice acts as the connection
                between the virtual and reality.

                With the above being said, it leads use into the idea of immersion. Looking at the quote of Paul
                Valery: "Just as water, gas, and electricity are brought into our houses from far off to satisfy our
                needs in response to a minimal effort, so we shall be supplied with visual or auditory images, which
                will appear and disappear at a simple movement of the hand, hardly more than a sign."
<br></br>
                Benjamin argues that technology will change the ways in which we experience art, and indeed the
                internet has fundamentally altered our experience. Which left the question: how artist would
                respond with the rise of internet. Well, Beloff’sresponse to this by making creative use of the
                medium, by creating this immersive world of The beyond. In her work “Emotions go to Work”, we
                see how she uses technology to turn our emotionsinto something valuable, or rather a piece of
                valuable art. Once again bringing back the use of memories, she uses interactivity and exploits the
                idea of mental geography, creating a very intimate one on one experience between the user and the
                art. This ultimately resulting in a immersive world the user can experience and get lost in.
                Overall , I can see why Beyond is considered one of the most famous virtual realities created. I think
                that this piece of art, (although it is creepy), is an outstanding piece with a very unique experience,
                that set the future possibilities at the time for interactivity and immersion in the digital space.
